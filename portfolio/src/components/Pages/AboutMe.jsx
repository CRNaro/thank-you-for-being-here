            <p>

As a passionate Full Stack Web Development student at UNH Coding Boot Camp, I am on a journey to transition my career from an accomplished Head Brewer with over a decade of experience in the brewing industry to a dynamic role in web development. My background in brewing has instilled in me a deep appreciation for the craft of creating, a meticulous attention to detail, and a relentless pursuit of quality and innovation. These attributes, combined with my current educational endeavor in coding, have equipped me with a unique set of skills and a fresh perspective that I am eager to apply in the tech industry.

Born and raised, New Hampshire, I have always been drawn to the arts and sciences. I completed my Bachelor of Arts Degree in Fine Art Studio with a focus in Drawing, and minors in Art History & Photography at Plymouth State University. This educational foundation has not only honed my creative skills but also developed my ability to think critically and solve complex problems. It was during my time in the brewing industry that I discovered my passion for continuous learning and growth, leading me to pursue a career in web development.

Throughout my eleven years in professional brewing, I have mastered the intricacies of brew chemistry, recipe building, and leading diverse teams. My roles at SoMe/York Beach Brewing Co and Throwback Brewery have allowed me to make significant contributions to the industry, including market analysis, product development, and ensuring the highest quality of production. My experiences have taught me the importance of adaptability, teamwork, and the pursuit of excellenceâ€”qualities that are equally essential in the fast-paced world of technology.

Currently enhancing my technical skills through the Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp at UNH, I have gained proficiency in key technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various database management systems. My ambition is to leverage my background in brewing and my newfound coding skills to contribute to innovative web development projects. I am particularly drawn to roles that offer opportunities for creative problem-solving, continuous learning, and personal and professional growth.

I am excited about the prospect of bringing my unique blend of creativity, technical skills, and industry experience to a new challenge in the tech world. My journey from art to brewing and now to web development is a testament to my passion for learning and my dedication to mastering new crafts. I am looking forward to contributing to a team where I can continue to grow, innovate, and make a meaningful impact.

Connect with me through Coursea or LinkedIn to discuss how I can bring my diverse skill set and fresh perspective to your team.  I would be happy to provide my email to serious recruitment leads.  Thank you for taking the time to read my profile and get to know me.
